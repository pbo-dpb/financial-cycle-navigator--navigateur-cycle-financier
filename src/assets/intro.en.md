One of the central roles of Parliament is to authorize and oversee Government spending. To spend money, the Government must receive Parliament’s approval. This happens one of two ways: either through ongoing legislation or on an annual basis through appropriation bills. The Estimates provide details on the spending authorities requested in these bills.

As part of its mandate, the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) provides analysis on the Government’s Estimates. By delivering non-partisan analysis of the Main and Supplementary Estimates, the PBO ensures that Parliament has a clear and accurate understanding of the Government's financial plans and the implications of proposed spending.

The PBO supports Parliamentary debate on the Estimates through:

-	Publishing regular reports on the Estimates documents; 
-	Briefing members of Parliament on the Estimates documents and process; and
-	Providing witness testimony in committees.
