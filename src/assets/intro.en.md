One of the central roles of Parliament is to authorize and oversee Government spending and taxation. The parliamentary financial cycle is an ongoing process through which Parliament considers the Governmentâ€™s taxation and spending plans and reviews actual spending and financial results. 
 
The PBO supports parliamentary debate throughout the financial cycle by:

- Publishing regular reports on the Budget and Estimates documents; 
- Providing independent cost estimates of Budget measures and legislation;
- Briefing members of Parliament on the Estimates documents and process; and
- Providing witness testimony in committees.

The Parliamentary Financial Cycle Navigator helps users visualize their current position within the financial cycle. It enables users to see what has been published and provides easy access to key documents. Additionally, the tool highlights existing and upcoming PBO reports that support parliamentarians in analyzing the Government's spending plans for the current fiscal year.
